# sql-challenge

This is my SQL challenge assignment for the UCI bootcamp. The assignment analyzes employee data that consists of different salaries, department numbers, names, titles, among other employee characteristics.

Schema file was created using the Quick Database Diagram tool that also helped generate the tables, primary keys, and foreign keys. A drop table if exists function and cascade function were needed to troubleshoot the issue of not having a unique column or key for the employees table.

Several types of queries were created to find out different information about the employee populatiom. The project required some different methods to extract the information from the database, such as using a filter function "WHERE," using "JOINS," using "GROUP BY," and "SORT BY." All tools were necessary to complete the assignment.
